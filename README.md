# Multi Agent Mini-Project

Given an enviroment and two agents (Mario and Bowser).

The goal is to write an algorithm that trains the two agents to navigate the environment while maximising thier reward.


## Value iteration MDP
We implemented a value-iteration process.

The value-iteration process is an MDP (Markov Decision Process) which solves Belmman's equation.

we start from initializing the utility of every state as zero and we set Î³ as 0.5. We then loop through states using the Bellman equation.
